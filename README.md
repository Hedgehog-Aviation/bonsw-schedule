# Buses of NSW Schedule maker
## **Attention: currently only working with route 702**
This application is very simple: it is a driver's timetable/scheduling app that will give timings for each stop of a route based on the start time.
Working on an exe format, but at the moment it requires running through Python. Route 702 is the focus of this application for the moment, however more routes will be added as time goes on.
The main difficulty is finding stop names and collecting reasonable timings between stops, so if anybody could help me with that, it would be awesome.
Solo developer without much time, so don't expect an update every 5 minutes.
Thanks for showing interest!
